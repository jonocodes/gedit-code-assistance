gedit code assistance is a plugin for gedit which provides code assistance for
C, C++, Objective-C, Python, XML, and RelaxNG.

Installation from git:

1) Install the following packages for your distribution
   (packages names can differ):

	1) gedit-devel (>= 3.0)
	2) llvm-devel (>= 2.8)
	3) vala
	4) libgee-devel
	5) lxml

2) Run:

./autogen.sh
make
make install

To install the plugin locally, use the --enable-local configure flag. This will
install the plugin in $HOME/.local/share/gedit/plugins

3) If you want your XML to validate against a schema, put a comment at the top
   of your XML file like so:

    <!-- schema: myschema.rng -->

The reference can be a local RelaxNG or XML Schema Document file. This plugin 
does not validate against more then one schema at a time.
